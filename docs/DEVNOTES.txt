The literal and quote problem
-----------------------------

20091024 PMA: The reasoning and history here is complicated so it needs to be
written down. Way back in the genesis of rst2beamer, a problem was encountered
with literals. The docutils LateX writer typeset them correctly in a regular
monospace (\ttfamily) font. However in Beamer documents they appeared as an
italic monospace font. This is because (a) docutils expresses literal blocks
as a \quote, and (b) the Beamer document class sets the quote font to be
italic. (See the beamer themes/fonts files.) Way back, I apparently solved
this problem by overriding the LaTeX writers' visit and depart methods for
literals.

Dim memory says that this worked in the days of docutils 0.4, but now
(docutils 0.6), it strips the indenting from literal blocks. The solution is
thus to use the parent literal methods, but to set the quote font to ttfamily
before visiting a literal and reset it after leaving. This appears to work.
